Creating a script to clone a database from a development environment to a local environment can vary depending on the type of database you are using.

Creating a script to clone a database from a development environment to a local environment can vary depending on the type of database you are using. Below is a general example script using mysqldump for MySQL databases. Make sure to replace placeholders such as DEV_DB_NAME, DEV_DB_USER, DEV_DB_PASSWORD, LOCAL_DB_NAME, LOCAL_DB_USER, and LOCAL_DB_PASSWORD with your actual database information.

Save the script as, for example, clone_database.sh. Make it executable using the following command:
chmod +x clone_database.sh

You can then run the script using:
./clone_database.sh

Please note that this script assumes you have the necessary permissions to create databases and import data. Adjust the script based on the specifics of your database system and environment. Additionally, always make sure to handle sensitive information like passwords securely and avoid storing them in the script itself for security reasons.
